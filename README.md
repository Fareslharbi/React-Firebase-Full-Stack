# Full Stack React Firebase Project with Context API State Management

This is a full-stack web application built using React, Firebase, and Context API for state management. The project provides a template for creating a real-time, dynamic web application with user authentication, database management, and state management using Context API.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used to handle the authentication process.

- Real-time Database: Firebase Firestore is used as the backend database to store and retrieve data in real-time.

- Context API State Management: The application uses React's Context API for state management, providing a centralized state and avoiding prop drilling.

- CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on certain resources.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org
- Firebase account: https://firebase.google.com

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/full-stack-react-firebase.git
cd full-stack-react-firebase
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Set up Firebase:

   - Create a new Firebase project from the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to "Authentication" and enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method.
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to "Firestore Database" and create a new Firestore database.
   - Set up the security rules for Firestore to ensure proper access control for your data.

4. Configure Firebase in the application:

   - In the project's root directory, create a new file named `.env.local`.
   - Open the `.env.local` file and add the Firebase configuration details:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc., with the actual values from your Firebase project.

5. Run the application:

```
npm start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **`components/`**: Contains all the reusable React components used in the application.

- **`context/`**: Houses the Context API implementation for state management.

- **`firebase/`**: Contains the Firebase configuration and initialization.

- **`services/`**: Defines different services for interacting with Firebase and the backend.

- **`App.js`**: The entry point of the application where components are rendered and the Context API provider is set up.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow the hosting instructions provided by Firebase. Typically, you can use Firebase Hosting to deploy the React application.

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

Ensure that your Firebase configuration in the `.env.local` file matches your production Firebase settings.
